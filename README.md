This project is an analysis of New York City parking tickets from 2017. We used the following DataSet

https://www.kaggle.com/new-york-city/nyc-parking-tickets

In New York City, ~10M parking tickets are issued every year.  The dataset on the parking tickets issued in NYC are collected by the NYC Department of Finance to aid in ticket resolution and guide policymakers.  
Our team is motivated to analyze such data sets to examine whether there are any noteworthy patterns between violations and types of cars, seasonality and locations: 
1. Are there any patterns between types of violations (violation codes) and features of cars (such as vehicle types, makers and colors of cars)?  
2. Are there any patterns in which agencies issue tickets?  
3. Are there any seasonality in violation?  Which months show more violations? 
4. Are there any trends in the locations (registration states and locations of the violation)?  

There are two general areas of application. One is from the perspective of Police/Policy Makers, and the other is from the perspective of citizens and business's that use commericial vehicles. Police and policy makers can use the data to decide where and how to distribute, as well as which parts of the city could use restructuring in terms of parking and standing areas for commerical vehicles. Average citiznes of the city and business's can look at the data to see which areas to avoid or be careful in for certain violations. The data can also be a tool for presenting grievences to the city to improve parking and other infrastructure.
